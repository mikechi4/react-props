## React Props Practice/Intro - Key Takeaways

It was a pretty simple concept to grasp imo. I've dived into this before with other tutorials, but I will say I didn't know you can wrap child components within a parent component's tag and it would be passed as props. I see the power of reusable components here and can see how I can use this towards projects at work IF we used React.

Also learned of a new library to use:
- FakerJS. Creates fake data for you to use. would be great for upcoming personal projects
