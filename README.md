## React Props Practice/Intro - Key Takeaways

It was a pretty simple concept to grasp imo. I've dived into this before with other tutorials, but I will say I didn't know you can wrap child components within a parent component's tag and it would be passed as props. I see the power of reusable components here and can see how I can use this towards projects at work IF we used React.
